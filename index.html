                <p style="margin-top: 0px;">My name is Ethan Bonsignori. I'm a 23 year old computer fanatic who also somewhat likes acting, theatre and video games. When I was born the internet had just started to become a mainstream thing and I loved it. However, there was the kicking people off the phone on accident while logging into AOL!</p>
                <p>About 15 years ago we moved to Savannah where I continued my love of the internet and computers. I played games like runescape religiously while taking breaks to play flash games on sites like albinoblacksheep and newgrounds. While I occasionally peaked into their code, I am still kicking myself for not diving deeper, disecting and rebuilding these things when I was young. Would've been a great head start! (It was always more fun just to play the games).</p>
                <p>For the past four years I've been working at the Savannah Theatre in Downtown Savannah. It's a lot of fun running the lightboard and helping with rental events, but I'm hoping I can take the knowledge of coding I gain from this class and use it to gain a career instead of a job!</p>
